ABSTRACT
Topic: Social Media Monitoring for Data Leakage Web Scraping, NLP, Public DataAnalysis
In the digital era, organizations increasingly rely on social media platforms for
communication, branding, and customer engagement. However, this widespread usage
also exposes them to the risk of data leakage, where sensitive or confidential information
may be unintentionally or maliciously shared online. This project focuses on developing an
automated system for Social Media Monitoring for Data Leakage using Web Scraping,
Natural Language Processing (NLP), and Public Data Analysis techniques.
The system continuously collects publicly available social media content through web
scraping and processes the extracted text using NLP-based models to detect sensitive
keywords, patterns, and anomalies indicating potential leaks. Advanced classification and
entity-recognition methods help identify confidential information such as credentials,
personal data, internal documents, or proprietary details. The analysed results are
presented through alerts and dashboards, enabling organizations to act quickly and reduce
security risks.
This solution enhances proactive cybersecurity by offering real-time monitoring,
automated detection, and early warning mechanisms, ultimately helping organizations
protect their digital assets and prevent data exposure across public platforms.
